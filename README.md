## Who am I?

Hi 👋, my name is **Fernando**.

- 👨‍💻 I'm a senior software engineer with 8 years of experience and passion for machine learning and game theory.
- 😎 By day, I'm the principal engineer at [Megali](https://megali.co.uk), my own software development agency.
- 🌃 By night, I'm a loving husband and father of two 🐶 and four 😸.
- ⏳ In my free time, I love to take long walks, spend time with friends and study about game theory and category theory.
- 🇧🇷 I'm based in sunny Brazil, and I'm available for remote work anywhere.
