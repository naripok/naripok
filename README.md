## Who am I?

Hello 👋, I'm **Fernando**.

- 👨‍💻 With 8 years of experience as a software engineer, I've developed a deep passion for intelligent systems.
- 🦾 During the day, I lead as the principal engineer at [Megali](https://megali.dev), my own software development agency.
- 🌃 By night, I'm a loving husband and father of two 🐶 and four 😸.
- 👁️ In my leisure time, I enjoy long walks, silence and thinking deeply about arcane subjects.
- 🇧🇷 Based in sunny Brazil, I'm looking to help you and your business, so together we can help the world.
